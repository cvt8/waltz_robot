Calculating extrinsic parameters...

Camera ext_valse_new_1_img:
Only 9 reference points for camera ext_valse_new_1_img. Calibration of extrinsic parameters may not be accurate with fewer than 10 reference points, as spread out in the captured volume as possible.

Camera ext_valse_new_img:
Only 9 reference points for camera ext_valse_new_img. Calibration of extrinsic parameters may not be accurate with fewer than 10 reference points, as spread out in the captured volume as possible.

--> Residual (RMS) calibration errors for each camera are respectively [101.865, 97.346] px, 
which corresponds to [411.201, 388.51] mm.

Camera synchronization
On Sunday 01. December 2024, 20:42:45
Project directory: /home/charles/coding/Pose2Sim/Demo_SinglePerson
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Synchronization is calculated on the whole sequence. This may take a while.
All keypoints are used to compute the best synchronization offset.
These keypoints are filtered with a Butterworth filter (cut-off frequency: 6 Hz, order: 4).
They are removed when their likelihood is below 0.4.

Synchronizing...
--> Camera valse and valse: 0 frames offset, correlation 1.0.
Synchronized json files saved in /home/charles/coding/Pose2Sim/Demo_SinglePerson/pose-sync.

Synchronization took 00h00m04s.

Multi-person analysis selected.

--> A person was reconstructed if the lines from cameras to their keypoints intersected within 0.1 m and if the calculated affinity stayed below 0.2 after excluding points with likelihood below 0.3.
--> Beware that people were sorted across cameras, but not across frames. This will be done in the triangulation stage.
